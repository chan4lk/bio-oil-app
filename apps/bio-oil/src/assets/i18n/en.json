    "TITLE": "About",
    "CONTENT": "In 1987 Bio‑Oil pioneered using oil to help improve the appearance of scars and stretch marks. At the time almost every product on the shelf was either a cream or a lotion, and the product was met with much scepticism. Today the product is the world’s leading scar and stretch mark product. In 2010 Bio‑Oil set up a specialist laboratory dedicated to researching how oil could be used to treat other skin concerns. In 2018 it launched an oil-based formulation for the treatment of dry skin. In Q3 2020 a natural version of Bio‑Oil's original scar and stretch mark product will be launched. Most of the laboratory’s development work over the past decade will come on stream in 2021. Bio‑Oil focuses exclusively on research and development, with the selling and distribution of its products licensed to leading skincare companies around the world.
